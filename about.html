The Maple Inn is a playground for adventure and nature to give tranquillity to minds. We have interacted with many people before we came up with a hotel that is always from home to give peach to soul and is yet contemporary. In The Maple Inn we give you an opportunity to try something new and unconventional. 
It is a green and peaceful retreat only 20 min from the vibrant and bustling city . It has been conceptualized keeping in mind home luxury. The food is also worked upon with great thought. The Mapple Inn is located in the city's most imposing yet serene edifice. The property is surrounded by beautiful lake reflection, lush green mountains and walkways. We offer lake and mountains facing and non facing 2 different types of accommodations for our guests, ranging from single-bedded hotel rooms to king size bedded cottages.
